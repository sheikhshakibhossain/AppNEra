**About the Author**

Sheikh Shakib Hossain is a Linux-first developer, researcher, and systems enthusiast focused on building practical, transparent, and user-respecting software. His work spans Linux desktop tooling, automation, Flutter apps, robotics, networking, and applied security research. He is especially interested in systems that run locally, remain offline-capable when possible, and give full control to the user rather than the platform.

Over the years, he has worked on a wide range of projects—from notification systems and academic automation tools to ROS 2–based autonomous rover stacks, sensor-fusion algorithms, and research prototypes aligned with green computing and efficient system design. Alongside development, he is actively involved in teaching programming and problem-solving, translating complex technical ideas into simple, practical knowledge.

His development philosophy is rooted in Unix and Linux principles: lightweight design, clarity over abstraction, and performance without unnecessary dependencies. He prefers native solutions, clean architectures, and open standards, avoiding bloat, telemetry, and opaque frameworks whenever possible.

**AppNEra** reflects this mindset. It is designed to empower Linux users to build and manage applications locally, with full ownership of their system and data—open-source, efficient, and built with care.
